In many real-world data sets, class imbalance is a common problem. An imbalanced data set occurs when one class (majority or negative class) vastly outnumbered the other (minority or positive class). The class imbalance problem is manifested when the positive class is the class of interest. We have obtained a real-world dataset of motor vehicle collisions in Canada, with an inherent imbalanced class problem.
