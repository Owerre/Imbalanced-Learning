# Canada Motor Vehicle Collisions (1999 - 2017)

In many real-world data sets, class imbalance is a common problem. An imbalanced data set occurs when one class (majority or negative class) vastly outnumbered the other (minority or positive class). The class imbalance problem is manifested when the positive class is the class of interest. We have obtained a real-world dataset of motor vehicle collisions in Canada, with an inherent imbalanced class problem.

##  Dataset Information:   [National Collision Database](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/1eb9eba7-71d1-4b30-9fb1-30cbdab7e63a)


## Fatality Rate

The figures below show the total fatality and fatality rate by different variables.

This figure below shows that young male drivers caused the most fatal collision.

This figure below shows that fatality rate is increased in older people.
